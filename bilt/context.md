Company: BILT, Inc.
Website: www.biltapp.com
Role: Fractional CMO
Responsibilities: Marketing and Sales Development
Three Go-To-Market motions: Consumer Durables, Government, and Commercial/Pro.
Primary Goal: Pipeline and revenue for Commercial/Pro. 
Primary projects in Q1 2026: 
1. Updated website with additional industry and use case pages
2. Update brand messaging and move website to Bilt.ai
3. Product marketing effort around pricing and packaging to accelerate pilot deals which are taking too long to activate

Here is the plan from May 2025. Much of this has been implemented, and I'll share some updates. 

BILT Pro/Commercial GTM Plan 

Synopsis 

The long-term future for BILT looks bright, with gigantic opportunities in play in the federal sector, as well as potential partnership opportunities with Walmart and others, and growing relationships with Apple, Amex, and Siemens. 

 

Big opportunities require patience, and to play the long game, BILT must meanwhile grow from other channels that offer more immediate and predictable revenue. The Pro/Commercial sector is the best combination of predictable recurring revenue and short-term feasibility.  

 

While BILT has made initial forays into this space, there has not been a complete commitment to the program. This plan outlines that full commitment, with the entire Go-To-Market team focused on driving success in this part of the business. 

The Goal 

$6M in total new ARR from Pro/Commercial market segment in 2026 

Assumptions (see worksheet)  

ACV: $75,000 

Conversion from qualified meeting: 25% 

What a meeting is worth: $18,750 

What we’re willing to pay in program/SDR costs to acquire a meeting: $8,000 

Number of meetings needed in Q4: 60 (5 per week, one per business day) 

Number of target accounts needed: 600 (we can estimate 10% of target accounts to take a meeting each quarter) 

Number of SDRs needed: 2 now, 4 later (quarterly goal of 12-20 qualified meetings each) 

 

The first Conversation: How do we generate meetings? 

Repeatable revenue scaling begins with quality conversations with qualified prospects. We need individuals whose primary objective is to create those conversations. That means hiring and training a team of dedicated SDRs. 

The Messaging 

Validate the firmographic segments for target accounts, including industries, business size, geography, and use cases. 

Build account list, starting with the “Pro 100” and following up with a Tier 2 list of “Pro 500” accounts 

Example: HVAC with US-based manufacturing 

Trane 

Carrier and ICP division 

Lennox 

Rheem 

Goodman 

Nortek 

Johnson Controls 

Modine 

AAON 

Validate the buying committee roles  

Who is our champion? 

Who has budget/authority? 

Security? Procurement? Who else will need to weigh in? 

Build messaging framework segmented by industry and role 

Define buying journey stages from first touch to contract 

Build out content templates for buying journey stages for industry and role 

Who do our buyers trust? Find influencers, podcasts, newsletters, and regional events to sponsor. Be present in our buyers’ existing communities and media 

The Content 

We have at least 3 deep content pieces for top to middle of the journey: 

Technical Trainers Report 

Buyer’s Guide 

Warshauer Study 

 

Over time we may want to test personalized versions by role and by industry. 

The Channels 

Outbound SDRS 

Email  

LinkedIn 

Outbound calling 

Account-based Advertising 

 

We can reduce spend on the ad agency and existing ad campaigns. What should we do instead?  

 

LinkedIn 

Consider LinkedIn Leadgen for driving engagement with halo assets 

Brand awareness ads to relevant teams at target accounts 

Retargeting with brand awareness ads to website visitors from target accounts 

Google Ads (Retargeting) 

Reddit allows targeting both by topic/interest as well as targeting a specific list of people. Here are some potential subreddit communities by topic: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/ (44k members) 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Training/ (9.4k members) 

https://www.reddit.com/r/FieldService/ (1.1k members) 

https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialMaintenance/ (28k members) 

https://www.reddit.com/r/datacenter/ (23k members) 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HVAC/ (211k members, all HVAC trade members) 

 

Lifecycle Nurture 

 

For any existing contacts in the database, it’s useful to keep a periodic pulse of content to remind them of BILT. This is especially valuable for prospects from target accounts who are exiting outbound cadences from SDRs. This way we don’t go completely silent. 2-3 touches monthly is appropriate. Here are a couple ways to get this rolling without having to spin up a massive content program: 

Monthly BILT Update newsletter (first week monthly) 

Audience: All opted-in B2B, plus everyone coming off outbound cadences 

Monthly thought leadership for instructional design (third week monthly) 

Audience: depending on title/role

Partners 

Explore potential partnerships for this specific market motion, including  

AWS (co marketing and coselling to target accounts 

LMS comarketing and coselling as technology partners 

 

Website 

Consider rebuilding the home page and navigation around a greater pro/commercial focus 

Consider using the BILTapp.com domain primarily for the apps, and building a B2G and B2B site on BILTcorp.com 

Add Website visitor tracking and signals 

Ungate technical report and buyers guide 

Consider creating technical report, buyers guide, and Deloitte study as web content rather than just downloads (OK to keep PDFs as an option). Web content is better for SEO and for tracking. 

The Tools: Embracing AI (at least where AI is ready) 

Existing 

Pardot for Lifecycle nurture 

Outreach for outbound SDRs (may need to upgrade plan for calling and seat licenses) 

Seamless.ai for contact and account information and potentially automating SDR activities 

LinkedIn Sales Navigator 

New 

Investigate Piper, Qualified, Factors, and other AI SDR capabilities 

Call recording (Avoma, Gong, Clari, etc.) 

Parallel dialer (Nooks, Orum) 

Signals and Website visitor tracking (Koala, Vector) 

Clay, Bitscale or other GTM Engineering for automating prospect scouting and routing 

Flip the Funnel! ABM Motion and Measurement 

Qualification happens up front, usually before activity. This is backwards from demand gen, where campaign activity is followed by marketing and then sales qualification. Target accounts and contacts are already qualified. 

Initially there may not be a Pain or a Timing signal for qualifying the opportunity. Because this is driven by outbound efforts. Pain must be discovered along with the prospect, and timing eventually results. 

Marketing and sales are working all target accounts and contacts together through the whole lifecycle. There is no “handoff” from marketing to sales. Sales may initiate engagement, and marketing may be working deep in the opportunity cycle to discover additional members of the buying committee and engage all of them 

Leadgen becomes less important because most key contacts are already identified 

Leadgen is replaced by “signals” of awareness, engagement, and consideration 

Form fills are mostly replaced by easier access to content 

 

All of the above applies to target accounts, though of course inbound and other demand gen activities can continue for other market segments, or for non-target accounts within Commercial/Pro. 

 

So what do we measure? 
 
1. Meetings with target accounts 

2. Conversion of meetings to opportunity and customer 

3. Individual contact journeys from awareness to engagement to consideration 

4. Eventually, with Multi-touch attribution, we can measure which touches from marketing and sales have impact on revenue 

The Cost 

 

We will ramp to this over 2-4 quarters. Some of this will be offset by changing priorities with existing marketing spend. So it’s not all net-new. 

 

We are willing to spend up to $160,000 / mo to acquire 20 additional qualified meetings with target accounts. (up to $8,000 per meeting).  

 

4 SDRs: $20,000/mo ($1,000 per meeting) 

Events, Meetups, Direct Mail, Gifting: $30,000/mo ($1,500 per meeting) 

Clay/Bitscale: $3,000/mo ($150 per meeting) 

Parallel Dialer: $2,000/mo ($100 per meeting) 

Avoma: $500/mo ($25 per meeting) 

LinkedIn: $30,000/mo ($50 per target account, $1,500/meeting) 

Reddit: $6,000/mo ($10 per target account, $300/meeting) 

Podcasts & Newsletters $5,000/mo, $250/meeting 

Vector: $1,500/mo ($75 per meeting) or Koala, $750/mo 

 

Risk Mitigation 

This plan has upside – some of these performance metrics can be exceeded with good effort, good timing, and good fortune 

This plan can be executed in full quickly, with full investment, or phased over multiple quarters, which gives us time to use feedback signals for a more efficient approach 

This plan focuses on proven, repeatable motions, and BILT has high confidence in its product/market fit.
