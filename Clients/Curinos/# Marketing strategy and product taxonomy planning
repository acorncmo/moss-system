# Marketing strategy and product taxonomy planning with Steven Dunston and Mike Jiwani

Fri, 23 Jan 26

### Customer Segmentation Strategy

- Three distinct customer segments identified:
  - Tier 1: Top 500 institutions (largest banks) - core focus, biggest revenue potential
  - Tier 2: Next ~1,000 institutions - viable targets, moderate growth potential
  - Tier 3: Bottom ~7,000 institutions - limited value, requires efficient demand gen to be profitable
- Tier 2 brings new logos that can grow into larger relationships over time
- Not a fast path to growth but worth investment with right approach

### Organization Structure & Goals

- Company goals cascading down through divisions in next 2 weeks
  - Will inform Steven’s group goals and individual performance targets
  - Individual performance goals set in March
- Steven’s division responsibility: maximize product monetization
  - Pricing and packaging optimization
  - Value engineering and business case development
  - Product strategy and benchmarking methodology
  - Product usage insights from Pendo data
- Key challenges:
  - Ad hoc pricing creating scaling bottlenecks
  - Manual analysis required for pricing performance reporting
  - Product hierarchy still being evolved, complicating packaging decisions

### Pricing & Value Engineering Initiatives

- Repricing programs targeting underpriced products:
  - $1.5M already repriced on pathway to $5M total
  - Additional products identified for repricing campaigns
- Value engineering produces fact-based collateral:
  - Client performance vs. peers analysis
  - Before/after product implementation comparisons
  - High vs. low usage client performance studies
- Business case development for complex products like Amplera:
  - Leveraging account-level data for precise ROI estimates
  - Recent RFP with Tangerine Bank, BMO engagement upcoming

### Marketing Operations & Engagement Scoring

- Comprehensive engagement scoring system implemented:
  - 0-100 score based on email opens, form submissions, webinar attendance, website visits
  - Weighted by seniority/job title for more accurate targeting
  - Integrated with buyer intimacy ratings and economic buyer tagging
- White space analysis being integrated into engagement platform
- Product usage insights from Pendo underutilized:
  - Currently requires ad hoc Excel analysis
  - Working toward systematic data exposure and democratization
- Account-based marketing strategy:
  - Product-centric (1-to-many) vs. Account-centric (1-to-1) approaches
  - Christa handling demand gen/campaign work
  - 1-to-1 ABM hire delayed due to budget pressures

### Hiring Priorities & Budget Constraints

- Product marketing manager hire at risk due to budget pressures
- Rival CMO sprint engagement starting early February (1-month engagement)
- Steven’s recommended hiring priority:
  1. Product marketer (prerequisite for effective downstream marketing)
  2. Account-based marketing manager (after proper systems established)
  3. Marketing operations role (currently hodgepodge of part-time resources)
- Marketing ops currently handled by:
  - Shannon (design person doing HubSpot management)
  - Value engineering team providing analytical support

### Tools & System Access

- Steven requested access to productivity tools:
  - OneCal for calendar synchronization
  - Claude/Copilot for AI assistance (Copilot more likely approved)
  - Granola for meeting transcription
- Kuranos uses Copilot, different transcription tool than requested
- Steven having technical difficulties with Kuranos meeting environment

### Next Steps

- Weekly 45-minute meetings scheduled Thursdays 2:15-3:00 PM ET
- Steven to meet with Haley and Aaron on recurring basis
- Steven to review marketing engagement score methodology and provide optimization recommendations
- Steven to assess current marketing ops setup and advise on urgency
- Steven to advocate for product marketing hire during budget discussions
