## What I Am (And What I'm Not)

### What I Can Do:
✅ **Research & Analysis**
- Research competitors, markets, companies
- Analyze data and identify trends
- Synthesize information from multiple sources
- Create comprehensive reports

✅ **Content Creation**
- Write meeting notes, status reports, presentations
- Create sales enablement materials (battle cards, one-pagers)
- Draft emails, agendas, and communications
- Build frameworks, templates, and playbooks

✅ **Document Management**
- Read, edit, and organize your files
- Format content into your templates
- Extract action items and insights
- Maintain documentation consistency

✅ **Strategic Support**
- Brainstorm ideas and approaches
- Provide frameworks for decision-making
- Offer perspective and recommendations
- Challenge assumptions constructively

### What I Can't Do:
❌ Access your email, calendar, or SaaS tools directly (you share info with me)
❌ Remember conversations after they end (each session starts fresh)
❌ Make decisions for you (I advise, you decide)
❌ Access real-time data unless you provide it

### Key Limitation to Remember:
**I don't retain memory between conversations.** When you start a new chat, I won't remember our previous discussions unless you reference files I created or tell me what happened.

**Workaround:** I can read any files in your Curinos folder, so I always have context from documents we've created together.

---

## How to Share Information with Me

### 1. Share File Paths (Best for Existing Documents)

**When to use:** You want me to read/edit existing files

**How:**
```
Read /Users/stevendunston/Documents/Clients/Curinos/First-Week-Onboarding.md
and tell me what I should focus on tomorrow.
```

**I can automatically:**
- Read any file in your Curinos folder
- Edit files you've already created
- Create new files in any subfolder

### 2. Paste Content Directly (Best for Quick Tasks)

**When to use:** Short notes, emails, quick content

**How:**
```
Here are my meeting notes from today's Product sync:

- Discussed Q1 roadmap
- Retail Deposit Optimizer 2.0 launching Feb 15
- Need battle card for S&P Global
- Sales team struggling with ROI messaging

Please format these into the stakeholder meeting template.
```

### 3. Describe What You Need (Best for Creation)

**When to use:** You want me to create something new

**How:**
```
Create a competitive battle card for S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Use the research in Competitive-Landscape-Overview.md as the source.
Make it one page, sales-ready, focused on our differentiation.
Save it to 06-Resources/Competitive-Intel/
```

### 4. Give Me Context (Always Helpful)

**Good:**
```
I have a meeting with the VP of Sales tomorrow about ABM strategy.
Create an agenda covering: ABM maturity assessment, target account
selection, and Q1 pilot proposal. Make it concise (30-min meeting).
```

**Even Better:**
```
I have a meeting with the VP of Sales tomorrow about ABM strategy.
She's skeptical of ABM and focused on short-term pipeline.
Create an agenda that addresses her concerns, shows quick wins,
and gets her buy-in for a pilot. 30-min meeting.
```

## Pro Tips for Working with Me

### 1. Be Specific About Format

**Vague:** "Create a competitive analysis"
**Better:** "Create a one-page competitive battle card for sales reps"
**Best:** "Create a one-page competitive battle card for sales reps in bullet format, highlighting where we win, where to be careful, and key proof points"

### 2. Tell Me the Audience

**Vague:** "Write about our ABM strategy"
**Better:** "Write an executive summary of our ABM strategy"
**Best:** "Write an executive summary of our ABM strategy for the CFO who cares about ROI and efficiency, not marketing tactics"

### 3. Give Me Examples or Templates

**Good:** "Create a weekly status report"
**Better:** "Create a weekly status report using Weekly-Status-Report-Template.md"
**Best:** "Create a weekly status report using Weekly-Status-Report-Template.md - keep the executive summary to 2-3 sentences like the template shows"

### 4. Iterate with Me

You don't have to get the prompt perfect. We can work together:

**You:** "Create a battle card for S&P Global"
**Me:** [Creates draft]
**You:** "Good start. Make it more concise - sales won't read this much. Focus on the top 3 differentiators only."
**Me:** [Revises]
**You:** "Perfect. Now create similar ones for ProSight and Darling."

### 5. Use Me for Thinking, Not Just Doing

**Doing:** "Format these meeting notes"
**Thinking:** "I have these meeting notes. Help me identify the biggest priorities and risks I should address this week."

**Doing:** "Create a project plan"
**Thinking:** "I need to launch ABM in 30 days with limited resources. What's the minimum viable approach to get wins and learn fast?"

### 6. Reference Previous Work

Since I can read your files, you can say:

```
Read the competitive analysis we created last week and create a
sales training deck based on it.
```

```
Look at my weekly reports from January and create a month-end
summary of accomplishments.
```

### 7. Tell Me When to Stop and When to Go

**When you want discussion first:**
"Don't create anything yet - just give me 3 options and your recommendation."

**When you want me to execute:**
"Create all 5 battle cards we discussed and save them to the competitive intel folder."

## What Makes a Great Prompt

### The Formula:

**1. What** (What do you want me to create/do)
**2. Why** (Purpose and audience)
**3. Source** (Where to get information)
**4. Format** (How it should look)
**5. Tone** (How it should sound)
**6. Where** (Where to save it)

### Example Using the Formula:

**What:** Create a competitive battle card for Earnix
**Why:** For sales reps to handle competitive objections (audience: sales team)
**Source:** Read Competitive-Landscape-Overview.md
**Format:** One page, bullet points, print-friendly
**Tone:** Confident, sales-ready, actionable
**Where:** Save to 06-Resources/Competitive-Intel/Battle-Card-Earnix.md

**Full Prompt:**
```
Create a competitive battle card for Earnix for sales reps to handle
competitive objections.

Read Competitive-Landscape-Overview.md for source material.

Format: One page, bullet points, print-friendly
Tone: Confident, sales-ready, actionable

Save to: 06-Resources/Competitive-Intel/Battle-Card-Earnix.md
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "You didn't include what I wanted"
**Solution:** Be more specific in your prompt, or tell me what's missing and I'll revise.

### "This is too long/short"
**Solution:** Tell me the ideal length (e.g., "1 page max", "3 bullet points", "executive summary in 2-3 sentences")

### "The tone isn't right"
**Solution:** Describe the tone you want (e.g., "more casual", "more data-driven", "more confident", "more humble")

### "You didn't use the template correctly"
**Solution:** Point out what's wrong and I'll fix it. Sometimes I need to see an example first.

### "I want to change direction"
**Solution:** Just tell me! "Actually, let's make this simpler" or "Can we try a different approach?"

---

## Remember

### I'm Best When You:
✅ Give me clear context and purpose
✅ Tell me who the audience is
✅ Show me examples or templates
✅ Let me know what success looks like
✅ Iterate with me ("good, now make it more...")

### I'm Less Helpful When You:
❌ Are vague about what you want
❌ Assume I remember our last conversation (I don't)
❌ Expect me to access tools I can't reach
❌ Don't tell me if I'm on the right track

---

## Advanced Uses

Once you're comfortable, try:

### Multi-Step Projects
```
I need to create a complete ABM playbook.

Step 1: First, read our Jan-May plan and tell me what should be in the playbook.
[I review and approve]

Step 2: Create the outline with sections.
[I review and approve]

Step 3: Fill in each section based on our discussions and documents.
[We iterate]

Step 4: Format it as a final deliverable.
```

### Brainstorming Sessions
```
Let's brainstorm ABM plays for community banks.

I'll share constraints and goals, you give me 10 ideas.
Then we'll narrow to top 3 and flesh them out.
Ready?
```

### Document Families
```
We need competitive battle cards for all 6 competitors.

Create the first one (S&P Global) and show me.
Once I approve the format, create the other 5 using the same template.
```
