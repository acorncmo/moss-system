# Stakeholder Meeting Prep
**Date:** January 22, 2026
**Context:** Follow-up from kickoff week, aligning on priorities and scope

## Kickoff Observations & Strategic Themes

### 1. ABM Scope: Lifecycle vs. Acquisition
**What I heard:** Curinos needs ABM throughout the customer lifecycle, not just late marketing/early sales stages.

**Implication:** Current plan focuses on acquisition ABM. Lifecycle ABM would add:
- Retention plays (at-risk accounts, renewal campaigns)
- Expansion plays (cross-sell/upsell into existing accounts)
- Advocacy plays (turning champions into references)

**To clarify:** Is lifecycle ABM in scope for Jan-May, or acquisition-focused first?

### 2. Foundational Positioning: The "Why" Gap
**What I heard:** New mission statement could have benefitted from a vision statement. Sid referenced Simon Sinek and finding Curinos's "why."

**Implication:** Product marketing and ABM messaging need a stable positioning foundation. If the "why" isn't settled, downstream work may feel disconnected or need rework.

**To clarify:**
- Is defining the vision/why in someone's scope?
- How stable is the positioning foundation I'll be building on?

**Notes:**

### 3. Business Model Transition: Advisory → Software
**What I heard:** Curinos is in early days of transitioning from an advisory firm augmented with data/software to a software company with professional services. Key is leveraging trusted advisors to unlock product opportunities.

**Implication:** This is potentially the biggest lever for product marketing:
- Messaging shift: Lead with product value, not relationship/advisory
- Sales enablement: Equip advisors to open doors for product sales
- Buyer journey: Product needs to sell itself more independently

**To clarify:** How central is this transition to what you want from me? Should this be the north star for the engagement?

**Notes:**

### 4. Pricing Transparency
**What I heard:** Pricing has gotten simpler. Question of whether it can become more transparent—potentially publishing a pricing framework.

**Implication:** Could be:
- Competitive differentiator
- Sales enablement asset (reduces friction, qualifies faster)
- Website/content play

**To clarify:** Is pricing transparency a marketing deliverable, or a product/finance decision I'd support?

**Notes:**

### 5. Tier 3/4 Bank White Space
**What I heard:** Question raised about white space with tier-3 and tier-4 banks. Who is marketing to them?

**Implication:**
- Potential new segment for ABM targeting
- May need different messaging (different pain points, budget, sophistication)
- Could be a growth vector product marketing helps unlock

**To clarify:** Is tier 3/4 expansion a 2026 priority? Should ABM include this segment?

**Notes:**


---

### 6. Executive-Level Aspiration
**What I heard:** How does Curinos get to where we provide data and metrics for board-level or C-suite KPIs?

**Implication:** Elevation of value proposition:
- Current: Operational tool for practitioners
- Aspiration: Strategic platform informing executive decisions

Product marketing should ladder messaging up to executive outcomes, not just practitioner features.

**To clarify:** Who's working on this aspiration? How does it factor into my scope?
